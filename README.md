# YTtoW2G-chrome

Extension that adds a button to YouTube thumbnails and the video page, which sends YT videos to an open W2G session. If a W2G session isn't open, the extension will open w2g.tv page, but you still need to start a session.

The extension adds a button to:

- video page
- thumbnails
- videos in a playlist
- shorts thumbnails

This is my first extension, so expect some bugs. I will try my best to fix them.
